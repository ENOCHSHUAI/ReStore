# ReStore Project

## Project Overview

ReStore is an online shopping platform where users can browse the product catalog, view product details, add items to the shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The frontend is built using React and TypeScript, with styling provided by MUI. The backend is developed using C# and .NET 6, with EF Core used for data persistence.

## Highlight of the Project

One aspect of this project that I am particularly proud of is my ability to aggregate information from the web, query resources, and enhance my self-learning skills. This allowed me to implement various features and ensure the projectâ€™s success.

## Basic Features Implemented

### Frontend Features
- **React Project**: Built using TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainable code.
- **MUI Styling Library**: Used MUI for styling, resulting in a visually appealing and responsive UI.
- **Responsive UI**: Ensured good display and functionality on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **React Router**: Implemented frontend routing for seamless navigation between different pages.
- **Git Usage**: Utilized Git for version control to ensure code security and traceability.

### Backend Features
- **.NET 6**: Built using C# and .NET 6, providing a robust backend support.
- **EF Core**: Used EF Core for database operations to achieve data persistence.
- **SQL Database**: Utilized SQLite as the database storage solution.
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, allowing users to manage products, shopping carts, and orders.
- **Git Usage**: Utilized Git for version control to ensure code security and traceability.
  
## Advanced Features Implemented

- **State Management with Redux**: Integrated Redux for efficient state management across the application.
- **Theme Switching**: Implemented theme switching functionality allowing users to toggle between dark and light modes.
- **Web Sockets**: Added real-time communication capabilities using Web Sockets.(Demo)



## Running the Project

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
    ```sh
    cd client
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the WebSocket server:
    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `API` directory:
    ```sh
    cd API
    ```
2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```

The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API will run at `http://localhost:5000`(http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html).

This project not only implements the core functionality of an e-commerce website but also enhances technical skills in both frontend and backend development, particularly in responsive design practice, state management, and real-time communication.
